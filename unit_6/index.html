<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
In 2015 I completed my Bachelor of Fine Art at RMIT, majoring in Gold and Silversmithing. I have been working away in my studio on the Mornington Peninsula ever since, creating unique handcrafted jewellery imbued with character and life. Growing up by the beach has given me an affinity with nature, which has influenced the style of the pieces I create. Each piece is handmade with a whole lot of love and I never make two pieces that are exactly the same. I believe that a piece of jewellery should be personal and reflect the wearer, which is why I also create to your order and preference.
